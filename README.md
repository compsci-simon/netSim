# Operation Starfire

### Description

The goal of this project is to simulate a network, including network devices, that one would typically find inside your home. The catch is that only 1s and 0s may be sent between devices.

### Phase 1 of the project

Connect all nodes together and simulate the ethernet protocol on the physical layer.

Encapsulate IP packets inside the link-layer frames. Then encapsulate Datagram packets inside IP packets.
