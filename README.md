# Operation Starfire

### Description

The goal of this project is to simulate a network, including network devices, that one would typically find inside your home. The catch is that only 1s and 0s may be sent between devices.

### Phase 1 of the project

Connect all nodes together and simulate the ethernet protocol on the physical layer.

Send signalling messages over the network (ARP Scanning) to discover hosts.
